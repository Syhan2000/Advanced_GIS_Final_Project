            <h1>Pedestrians Safety for Older New Yorkers</h1>
            <p>As New York City's senior population grows, their safety is crucial. Although they make up less than 15%
                of the population, seniors account for over 45% of pedestrian fatalities. The number of senior
                pedestrian fatalities has remained steady despite Vision Zero efforts. Safety measures like Road Diets,
                bicycle lanes, pedestrian islands, and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs) can reduce these injuries.

                <h3>Road Diets</h3>
                <p>Removing or narrowing lanes, often referred to as road diets, can reduce traffic speeds and can also
                    reduce pedestrian exposure to moving vehicles. Lane removal typically means converting a four lane
                    road to three lane road: two travel lanes and one turning lane in the middle. This “right-sizing” of
                    the road provides the appropriate number of travel lanes for vehicular demand. Reducing travel to
                    one lane also reduces vehicle speeds and dangerous weaving movements by eliminating the passing
                    lane. Additionally, removing a travel lane means less exposure to traffic when a pedestrian crosses
                    the street. Fewer active travel lanes means fewer interactions between pedestrians and turning
                    vehicles. Turning vehicles are involved in about half of all senior injuries.</p>

                <h3>Conventional Bike Lanes</h3>
                <p>Installation of new bike lanes usually coincides with the removal or narrowing of vehicle lanes.
                    Space for bike lanes is typically made from removing parking, removing a travel lane, or narrowing
                    existing lanes, and sometimes a combination of the above. Bike lanes help slow traffic by visually
                    tightening the roadway, and signaling that other road users, particularly vulnerable road users, are
                    present. Painted bike lanes, or Class II lanes appear to greatly reduce the severity of crashes
                    involving senior pedestrians.</p>

                <h3>Protected Bike Lanes</h3>
                <p>Protected bike lanes provide greater safety benefits than conventional bike lanes, greatly reducing
                    KSI and injuries for both seniors and non-senior adults. These lanes are separated from vehicular
                    traffic by hard infrastructure, like plastic bollards/ delineators, painted pedestrian space or a
                    row of parked cars, usually requiring lane or parking removal (or both). At the intersection,
                    protected bike lanes often include pedestrian islands. These islands slow turns, shorten crossing
                    distances for pedestrians and increase pedestrian visibility to drivers.</p>

                <h3>Pedestrian Islands</h3>
                <p>Concrete pedestrian islands (including variations such as center medians and median tips/extensions)
                    provide refuge, reduce exposure and slow vehicular turns. Islands often divide roads into two travel
                    directions, splitting the crossing into two separate lengths and reducing the crossing distance.
                    This separation gives pedestrians a place to wait safely if they do not have enough time to cross
                    the whole road before signals change. Older pedestrians may also require a longer crossing time than
                    non-senior adults. They may not be able to cross an entire street unless they start at the very
                    beginning of the crossing phase, and so the islands provide a safe place to wait for the next
                    signal.</p>

                <h3>Curb and Sidewalk Extensions</h3>
                <p>This category of treatment includes any expansion of the sidewalk and curb with painted pedestrian
                    space or concrete, including neckdowns and block long sidewalk extensions. Curb and sidewalk
                    extensions reduce exposure by reducing crossing distances and can slow turn speeds by changing the
                    angle at which drivers must make the turn. Curb extensions also increase visibility at intersections
                    by putting pedestrians who are about to cross more into the drivers’ field of view, helping to
                    reduce potential failure to yield crashes.</p>

                <h3>Turn Calming</h3>
                <p>Turn Calming refers to a suite of low-cost interventions deployed at locations with histories of
                    pedestrian and bike injuries involving turning vehicles (mainly left turns). These treatments are
                    used to change the angle of the vehicle turn and to reduce pedestrian exposure in the crosswalk.
                    Rubber speed bumps or plastic bollards are installed on the inside corner of the turn on one-way
                    streets (“slow turn wedge”), or in between travel lanes on two-way streets (“hardened center line”)
                    to force vehicles to make turns at more of a right angle. This angle slows turn speeds and puts
                    pedestrians crossing directly in front of the driver’s point of view, increasing their visibility.
                    The hardened center line also reduces the exposure of the crossing pedestrians to turning vehicles,
                    as most vehicles will turn to avoid the bollards or rubber speed bumps. These treatments strongly
                    benefit senior pedestrians in reducing traffic injuries. It is likely that this treatment benefited
                    seniors more than non-senior adults because it targets a specific crash type (left turning vehicles)
                    that is overrepresented for senior pedestrians in NYC.</p>

                <h3>Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs)</h3>
                <p>An LPI is a traffic signal treatment where a crossing pedestrian receives several seconds of “head
                    start” on the walk signal before parallel vehicular traffic is permitted to move and turn across the
                    crosswalk. LPIs reduce pedestrian exposure and improve yielding rates by separating pedestrian and
                    vehicle movements at intersections and putting pedestrians in a location more visible to drivers
                    when they begin turning. In NYC, this head start is typically seven seconds. Assuming pedestrians
                    begin crossing when their phase begins, pedestrians may be able to cross most of the street, or be
                    at least towards the middle of the crosswalk before any driver starts turning.</p>
