# Pedestrians Safety for Older New Yorkers
Wecome to Pedestrians Safety for Older New Yorkers! This project utilizes Mapbox GL JS to provide a map-based tool for exploring various actions of senior pedestrian safety in New York City. Users can find the current citywide transportation programs and street design changes here that contribute to building a safer city for senior.

New York City's senior population is growing rapidly, similar to national trends, while the rest of the population slightly declined. Seniors now comprise nearly 15% of the city's population. Despite overall pedestrian safety improvements and declining fatalities under the Vision Zero initiative, senior pedestrian fatalities have remained relatively unchanged, making seniors a larger percentage of total annual pedestrian fatalities. The NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) has implemented over 900 street improvement projects since 2010, including protected bike lanes and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs). However, these efforts have not benefited older New Yorkers as much as younger populations. This study builds on the NYC DOT Safe Street for Seniors (SSFS) program, which was launched in 2008 to address high senior pedestrian fatality rates. The DOT's analysis shows that safety treatments reducing vehicle speeds, pedestrian exposure, and providing refuge significantly reduce injuries among seniors, highlighting the need for targeted solutions to protect the city's growing senior population.
